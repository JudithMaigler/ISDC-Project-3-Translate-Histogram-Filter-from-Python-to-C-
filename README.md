# ISDC-Project-3-Translate-Histogram-Filter-from-Python-to-Cpp

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to take the python code you wrote when you implemented the two dimensional histogram filter and translate it into C++.

After you review the Python code you will download some starter C++ code. Your job is to complete the functions marked with TODO comments until the histogram filter works as expected!

NOTE - when compiling your code, make sure you use C++11. You can do this from the command line with the following:

g++ -std=c++11 tests.cpp


## Directory Structure

You should create a new project folder/directory to put the project code into. Inside that you should also create a maps directory.
